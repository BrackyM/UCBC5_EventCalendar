# Braxton M | UCBC5_EventCalendar | README

In this challenge, we were tasked with a list of acceptance criteria (featured below this section) to add a JavaScript file that would make a working Event / Work Day Calendar

* We would use JavaScript, Jquery, and moment libraries
* Display the current date and a timetable calendar below
* The current, past, and present hours during the day will be highlighted in different colors
* Add the ability to save events in the calendar and remain present locally when refreshed

This project was given starter code.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
